This project is all about listing games chosen and reviewed by RKG.
RKG (Rain Kin Games) is an organization that designs, reviews, 
publishes, and plays table top board games. 

This app allows followers of the RKG Organization the ability 
to directly affect what games we play coming up. They can submit
their name, email, and an entry for a game that the group should 
play. RKG staff and personalities will play the game, review it, 
and if it is a favorite they will add it to the site with credit 
to the users who suggested it. 

The app is simple and it's a leader board / public hall of fame 
for RKG followers to submit their games. If a user appears multiple
times on the leader boards they will get RKG Perks!
